= Motivation
For the project we intend to do the creation of an IR system from scratch. The motivation for this mostly stems from the fact that we will learn the most from this and can see the impact of different.

= Research question
Our goal is to try and create the best possible IR system we can, 

= Resources
We want to use pythong for the project as it has a lot of libraries that can help us implement key parts of the system.

For our document collection we intend to use the ROBUST dataset from 2005, that uses the "AQUAINT Corpus of English News Text" , this dataset contains news articles from three different sources. It also comes with 50 hard queries.

As far as ranking models other than lexical retrieval we envision the use of...
We want to try and use the pretrained language model BERT, and use embedded versions of the documents along with the queries to try and get better results than the pure lexigraphical approach such as BM25.
